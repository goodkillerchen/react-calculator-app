# Introduction
This project is an online calculator made by the `React framework`. When users login, they can use the online calculator. This project mainly realizes three functions: registration, login and online calculator.

This project is mainly created by the `React framework`, `React Router` and `React Redux`. It is an SPA(single page application). At its core, what React Router does is conditionally render certain components to display based on the route used in the URL. To switch between functions, I tried `React Router`. I use the `React Redux` to realize the function of online calculator.
